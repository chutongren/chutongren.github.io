My name is Chutong Ren. I was born in Qitaihe (a small city in northeast China). I studied in Shanghai for six years and have been living and studying in Munich for the past two years. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Donghua University, Shanghai, China, and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.
