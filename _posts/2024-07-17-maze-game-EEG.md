Have you ever thought about controlling something just by using your brainwaves? Well, that’s exactly what we tried in this project — playing a maze game controlled by EEG signals.

I have to say, our EEG device is pretty old, so it gave us a lot of headaches. The electrode contacts were unstable despite putting on lots of saline solution. One electrode near the right eye, AF4, was actually broken. Plus, the data recording software kept crashing, and the Bluetooth connection kept dropping. Our experiments felt like an endless loop of frustration. 

But somehow, when we finally managed to run a test successfully — everything worked smoothly! Too bad we forgot to record that moment. Later tries were less perfect, and the system sometimes struggled to recognize left-eye blinks reliably.

Not last but least, big shoutout to my teammate Wenlong! He’s seriously smart and super nice, with great expertise and an even better attitude. I couldn’t have done it without him.
