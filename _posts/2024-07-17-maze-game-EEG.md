Artifacts such as eye blinks or chewing typically have amplitudes around 100 μV, while EEG signals are much weaker — around 10 μV — and therefore harder to capture accurately. Normally, we do our best to remove these artifacts and noise in order to obtain a “clean” EEG signal for analyzing brain activity. However, in this project, we took a different approach: instead of removing artifacts, we used them directly as features to control movement in a maze game. 

collect data to train SVM model. 
I have to say, this device is to old. We always met dead loop questions. broke down. can't be recognised and connect to its corresponding app on computer.  
is shown in this video.
